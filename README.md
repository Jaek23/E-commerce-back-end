# E-Commerce SQL Back-End

## Description
This is the thirteenth challenge for the UTA boot camp. This project was created to utilize Node/Seqaulize. For this challenge, I was focused on creating HTTP request routes that will run as determined by the user's request for handling products. With this built-in back-end route, users will be able to manage their products, make edits accordingly, and operate the (CRUD) method. 

## Usage 
1. Clone the repository
2. Open up the integrated terminal in your code editor and seed the data
3. Once the data is seeded, start the server!
4. Since there is no front-end set, you can run the routes through any client-based applications
